# Rhabit React App -Benjamin-G

This app is made to connect to the Rhabit API on localhost/3000.

Rhabit API can be found here:
https://github.com/Benjamin-G/rhabit-api

Please have the API running before you boot up this App; both should be running on your local machine to demo this.

## Installation and Running

Either yarn or npm should work, I recommend yarn:


`$ yarn install
$ yarn dev-server`

this will boot up a dev-server on localhost 8080.
